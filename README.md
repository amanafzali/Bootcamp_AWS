# Instructions

In this project, I used Amazon Web Services skills that I learned in the past week with my already  Python experience, to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan. Amazon Lex, Amazon Lambda and lambda_function.py were used to accomplish the following main tasks.


## Stepts for creating an Advisor bot

1. **Initial Robo Advisor Configuration**: 
Defined an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about the requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

2. **Build and Test the Robo Advisor**: I have built and tested the bot to make sure that my bot is working and responding accurately along with the conversation with the user.

3. **Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function**: Created an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This task I have included testing the Amazon Lambda function and making the integration with the bot.
